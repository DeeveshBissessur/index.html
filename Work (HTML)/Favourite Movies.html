        My Top 3 movies of all time

    <h3>
        Black Clover Sword Of The Wizard King
    </h3>

    <p>
        This is one of the best released movies yet, since it has amazing graphics, a great story line and is considered a part of the history. The movie also introduced a few overpowered characters that were really difficult to defeat for the main cast.

    <h3>
        Jurassic Park
    </h3>

    <p>
        This is one of the best science fiction movies, I had seen, not because I was a fan of dinosaur and science. The way they recreated dinosaurs and also to modify them was very impressive especially when I was watching the movie as a child.

    <h3>
        Lucy
    </h3>

    <p>
        This movie was one of the most confusing yet interesting film I had seen, not because of the 10% brain myth but the supposed use of drugs to enhance the brain and also the supposed 100% brain efficiency. The last minutes were very interesting because the movie showed us the supposed the hypothethical start of the universe and also what was there before the big bang.
